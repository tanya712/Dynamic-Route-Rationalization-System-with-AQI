
# Dynamic Route Rationalization System with AQI

This project optimizes route selection dynamically based on real-time traffic data and air quality index (AQI). It combines machine learning models for travel duration prediction and a web-based interface for visualization.

## Features
- Real-time AQI and traffic-based routing
- ML/DL models for duration prediction
- Interactive web interface with Flask
- Multiple UI prototypes

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- joblib, pickle, h5 models
